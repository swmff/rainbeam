# Terms of Service

## (1) Introduction

This document (“Terms of Use” or “Terms of Service”) defines the basis in which access to our services (“Rainbeam”, “Neospring”) is granted. This document also defines the control we have over all content uploaded to the site where it is visible to the public or accessible by anyone; information, text, graphics, photos (“Content”). By registering an account or using our services, you agree to these terms and are constrained by the rules defined here.

## (2) Usage

You agree that you will not register an account while unable to form a binding contract to these terms.

The act of “hoarding” or squatting usernames on our services is not allowed. We reserve the right to terminate any account found to be created with the intention of blocking others from using a given username.

All content you upload to our services must be acceptable by these terms and the laws of the country in which our servers are located.

All content uploaded to our services must not be intended to harass or upset the public, encourage dangerous activities, promote hate, depict shocking or distressing things, include threats or promote acts of violence, discriminate against other users, promote crime, spam, or break these terms in any other way.

Rainbeam reserves the right to cease or temporarily suspend access to our services at any time. By registering a profile, you agree that Rainbeam is not responsibly for any damages caused by the suspension of our services whatsoever.

Rainbeam allows all types of user content to be reported. Mass reporting content will result in mass IP banning. All reports found to be associated with a targeted attack on a user using reports will be IP banned. Users should report individual responses, questions, or comments if they believe they are in violation of these terms.

## (3) Content

By uploading or providing content to our services, you agree that you are solely responsible for it and are the sole recipient of any consequences resulting from the content you have provided.

Rainbeam does not welcome any form of harassment towards other users (“profiles”) on the platform (“Rainbeam”), as well as the sharing of illegal or illicit content.

We reserve the right to restrict your access to content or your ability to upload new content at any time if it is seen fit.

Content uploaded or created using our services must not contain any references or depictions of people under the age of 18 in sexual situations or undertaking sexual acts. All content created which references nudity in any way, including through text, must have an NSFW (“Not Safe For Work”) labelled applied to it. Profiles which regular partake in the creation and sharing of NSFW content must have the NSFW label applied to their account as a whole. Content must also not include links to this material without a warning or account label, either.

Profiles marked as NSFW are not required to provide individual warnings on their responses, as they are already removed from public feeds. Profiles which are not marked as NSFW are expected to provide warnings on every response which includes NSFW content.

## (4) Consequences

Violation of these rules will result in a permanent or temporary suspension from our services. We reserve the right to provide no explanation when taking action against your account.

Circumventing blocks from our services will result in larger blocks and is not allowed in any capacity. This includes using a VPN to avoid service-wide IP blocking,
