Rainbeam is a simple Q&A social network designed for community! On Rainbeam, users can create and customize their profile to look how they want, and then other users can ask them questions using their account or an anonymous username. Users receive questions in their inbox and can then answer them or manage them. Users can also ask ‚Äúglobal questions‚Äù which everybody who is following them can see in a specialized timeline. Global questions can be answered by any logged-in user. Users can also respond to existing responses with comments to further interact with their friends' responses!

## Repository structure

All core packages are contained in the `crates/` directory:

* `crates/builder/` - Client asset builder/bundler
* `crates/shared/` - Core shared utilities
* `crates/langbeam/` - l10n service
* `crates/databeam/` - Database connection manager
* `crates/authbeam/` - Authentication backend and API routes
* `crates/citrus/` - Citrus federation protocol client
* **(v)** `crates/rainbeam-core/` - Rainbeam database connection and types
    * `crates/rb/` - Rainbeam Axum routes (API and all pages)
    * `crates/rainbeam/` - Rainbeam server binary

Packages labeled with `(v)` are *version-tied*. This means that it and all the packages nested under it in the list share the same crate version.

## Usage

To start, clone the Rainbeam repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swmff/rainbeam
cd rainbeam
```

The Rainbeam server is built for Linux systems. Development is possible on Windows, but it is recommended that production servers be run on Linux amd64/aarch64 systems.

You'll need [just](https://just.systems/man/en/introduction.html) for many steps of our build process. You'll also need cargo with rustc version 1.83 minimum. Any recent Node.js version will also be needed.

To start, you'll need to build the website:

```bash
cd crates/web && bun i && cd ../../
just web-build
```

After the website has been built, you can build the backend binary:

```bash
just build sqlite
```

Instead of ‚Äúsqlite‚Äù, you can also use ‚Äúmysql" or "postgres‚Äù for MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL respectively!

Then, you must build the main binary which run the website and API backend:

```bash
just build-bundle
```

To configure Rainbeam, create a `config.toml` file in `./.config` and `./.config/databeam`. You can copy the example files and edit them to your needs.

```bash
cp ./.config/config.example.toml ./.config/config.toml
cp ./.config/databeam/config.example.toml ./.config/databeam/config.toml
```

All configuration files for `./.config/config.toml` (the main configuration file) are available [here](https://swmff.github.io/rainbeam/rainbeam/config/struct.Config.html). You can find the databeam (database connection) configuration file options [here](https://swmff.github.io/rainbeam/databeam/sql/struct.DatabaseOpts.html).

Once everything has been built and configured, you can start the server with `just run`.

### Configuration

You can configure Rainbeam in the configuration file located at `./.config/config.toml`. This file will be created for you when the server is first run.

#### Tier features

You can lock a given set of features behind the `tier` column of profiles using the `tiers` configuration key.

```toml
[tiers]
double_limits = 2
avatar_crown = 1
profile_badge = 1
# ...
```

The `tiers` configuration key contains a map of features where the key is the feature name, and the value is the minimum required tier.

By default, every benefit is at tier `1`.

### hCaptcha

Rainbeam requires hCaptcha to secure logins and registers. You can provide your h-captcha configuration in `./.config/config.toml`:

```toml
# ...
[captcha]
site_key = "..."
secret = "..."
```

You can sign up for an hCaptcha account at <https://www.hcaptcha.com/>!

### Moderation

After you have created your first account, you'll need to manually create a permissions group in the database so that you can mark the account as a `Manager`. The manager permission allows you to delete accounts, responses, comments, and questions. You can also view profile warnings and reports with this permission. You can view an example SQL query to do this [here](https://github.com/swmff/rainbeam/blob/master/sql/moderation.sql)!

You can add additional moderators with the `Helper` role. They can also be given `Manager`, however `Helper` is much better if you want them to have limited moderation abilities.

### Account registration

To open your instance up for free account registration, you'll need to set `registration_enabled` to `true` in `./.config/config.toml`.

### PWA

You are responsible for adding your own `manifest.json` file in the `static/` directory.

You can place your PWA logo images in `static/images/logo/`. This directory is ignored by git.
